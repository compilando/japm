## 6. Success Criteria

### Milestone 4 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All controllers have appropriate audit decorators
- [ ] Audit logs are properly aggregated in production
- [ ] Performance impact is within acceptable limits (<5% overhead)
- [ ] Security audit passes with no critical findings
- [ ] Documentation is complete and up-to-date

### Quality Gates
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for audit system
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] All audit events are properly captured
- [ ] Log retention policies are implemented

## 7. Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Medium**: Logging performance impact on high-traffic endpoints
- **Low**: Log storage costs in production
- **Low**: Audit log data privacy compliance

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement async logging for non-critical audit events
- Configure log retention and archiving policies
- Regular performance monitoring and optimization
- Legal review of audit data handling procedures
